  Are you sure you want to email your forms to the clerk now?
subquestion: |
  When the court gets your form, they will email you. The email includes a link to the webpage where you can pay your/defendant's bail. 
  
  After you pay the full amount of 
  % if person_filing == "obo":
  ${ defendants[0].name.first }'s 
  % else:
  your
  % endif
  bail, the court will notify the facility that bail has been posted.
  
  And the facility will begin the process of releasing 
  % if person_filing == "obo":
  ${ defendants[0].name.first }
  % else:
  you
  % endif
  .
  <div class = "">Note</div>
  The court only processes requests to post bail online as follows:
   
  <table>
  <th>
  <tr>
    <td>**in-custody defendants**</td>
    <td>**out-of-custody defendants**</td>
  </tr>
  </th>
  <tr>
    <td>Monday through Friday: 8am to 4pm</td>
    <td>Monday through Friday: 8am to 4pm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Saturday and Sunday: 10am â€“ 3pm
    <td> nbsp; </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  Online bail payments can be made with a VISA or MasterCard credit card or debit card. You cannot pay with an American Express or Discover card.

  Each credit card transaction will be assessed a 3% convenience fee. If/when bail is later returned (exonerated) to the payer, the fee will not be returned.

  If bail is more than $97,000, the person posting bail must make more than one payment until the total amount paid equals the total of bail. For example, if bail is $250,000, make three payments: Payment 1 = $95,000 + 3% fee, Payment 2 = $95,000 + 3% fee, and Payment 3= $60,000 + 3% fee. A single payment cannot exceed $99,999 including the 3% convenience fee.
